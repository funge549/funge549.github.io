		<p>My favourite website is <a href="http://www.lancewyman.com/index.php">this one!</a></p>
		<p>This is Graphic Designer Lance Wyman's website. I enjoy this website as I admire and enjoy the projects and designs that he has done thorughout his career. One great quality of his website is the responsiveness of the index page, as the arrangement of the icons (projects) differ depending on the size of the server. As a student I'm also very intrigued by the design of the various  complex systems of his, and how they are very visually appealing and easy to understand by the user. </p>

		<p>The common denominator between all HTML documents is that they all follow a basic structure. Which starts with the declaration of the document, this will declare the nature of the document. All HTML documents will have a head, body and maybe a footer. Within these elements there are certain tags that can be used to create the content of the document. </p>

			<li> Block-level elements always start on a new line and take up the whole width of the window. The most common element is the div tag</li>
			<li> In-line level elements don't start on a new line and only takes up the necessary amount of the width. The most common element is the span tag</li>
